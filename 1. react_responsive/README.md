# React Responsive App

It is a React App built with **Formik**, **Yup**, **Styled Components**, **React Routers**, **React Spring**, localStorage API etc.

It will be similar to this when you test it in your machine.

## How it was made

It was tested with React Testing Library, Cypress, ESLint etc. They are not included in this project to make it simple.

The app is served by **Express** in this project. [You can also test it with Actix, Rocket, Restify, Django, Vibora, Golang](https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack/tree/master/React_Rust) and potentially with **Warp** also.

The design and CSS insturction were already given. I made my own verison and tweaked some parts with the different image.

## How to test it locally

If you are already familar with git, it won't be difficult. Follow the simialr process given below and you will see the app working at your machine.

```console
$git clone git@github.com:steadylearner/resume.git
$git checkout deploy
$cd resume/1. react_responsive

```

## More React and Frontend Development Examples

The frontend part of [Steadylearner](https://www.steadylearner.com/blog/search/React) is built with React, Redux with localStorage API, Webpack, Styled components etc and server with Rust Rocket.

[If you want, you can also verify how it was deployed with this post.](https://www.steadylearner.com/blog/read/How-to-deploy-Rust-Web-App)

I also made NPM React package [prop-passer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-passer). It is not that popular but it was a good opportunity to learn how to use NPM and Functional Programming.

I also made [Rust Chat App](https://www.steadylearner.com/blog/read/How-to-start-Rust-Chat-App) example. You can also find the full stack Rust version at [Rust-Full-Stack]. You can also learn how to make it with [Rust blog posts](https://www.steadylearner.com/blog/search/Rust).
