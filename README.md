# Introduction

This is to help others to test the example projects from [Steadylearner](https://www.steadylearner.com). The easiest one to test will be **1. react_responsive**.

I have spent a decent amount of time for React development. But, I currently have more interest in server side development and the databases. **2. express_mongoose**, **3.rust_grpc**, **4.express_auth_redis_postgres** is to show some examples for that.

I already deployed some projects to AWS with Docker and DigitalOcean with Nginx and Linux.

For this repository, I could make [Rust Warp REST end points, Tonic gRPC server, Postgresql from AWS RDS and Redis wrapper for it](https://www.steadylearner.com) deployed at AWS. You can verify the entire project at **3.rust_grpc**.

I also plan to make Rust version of **2.** and inlcude it to **3.** later with [mongodb crate](https://crates.io/crates/mongodb)
and write [blog posts](https://www.steadylearner.com/blog/search/Rust) for it later.

## How to test it

I let **README.md** for each directory. Use **$git checkout deploy** after you clone this repository and follow the instructions.

I will make **3.rust_grpc** active currently. If necessar, I would make others deployed in few hours.
